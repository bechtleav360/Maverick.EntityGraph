# Requirements for Versioning

* Implement the memento pattern: don't use explicit versioning, but show the entity state at the given time
* Don't have explicit version (or revision) links as part of the entity (since 99% of the time client's are not
  interested in the history).

# Versioning through transactions

We can and should represent an entity as graph

The graph is a collection of statements (a linked data fragment) which together draw a complete picture of an entity.

## Forming the entity

We consider everything having the same id with in the entities namespace to be one particular entity. In this case, the
entity in question
is a Meeting invitation for Bob. The graph representation includes the meeting, but also the FOAF representation as Bob
as attendee.

## Adding Provenance

Definition according to W3C:

> Provenance of a resource is a record that describes entities and processes involved in producing and delivering or
> otherwise influencing that resource.

> In PROV, physical, digital, conceptual, or other kinds of thing are called entities. Examples of such entities are a
> web page, a chart, and a spellchecker. Provenance records can describe the provenance of entities, and an entityâ€™s
> provenance may refer to many other entities. For example, a document D is an entity whose provenance refers to other
> entities such as a chart inserted into D, and the dataset that was used to create that chart. Entities may be described
> as having different attributes and be described from different perspectives. For example, document D as stored in my
> file system, the second version of document D, and D as an evolving document, are three distinct entities for which we
> may describe provenance.

In the following example, we have two versions. In the first version of the meeting, Sarah was supposed to attend.

He declined and forwarded the invitation to Sarah.

This example illustrates how we can express versions through the provenance ontology.

An interesting variation here would be: What if Sarah has since then married Bob and taken his name, she is now known
as "Sarah Bobson"?
